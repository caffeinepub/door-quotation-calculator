      "featureTitle": "Refactor `DoorEntryForm.tsx` and `DimensionInput.tsx` to accept dimension input as a free-text string that supports both decimal format (e.g., '79.25') and fraction format (e.g., '79 1/4', '79 3/8'). Each input field must be full-width, stacked vertically (Height first, then Width — not side by side), with label 'Door Height (inches)' and 'Door Width (inches)' respectively. Placeholder text must show '79 1/4 or 79.25' for height and '30 1/4 or 30.25' for width. A helper text line below each input must read 'Enter as decimal (79.25) or fraction (79 1/4, 79 3/8)'. The parser must convert fraction strings (whole + numerator/denominator, e.g., '79 1/4', '79 3/8') into a decimal inches value before passing to `findCatalogueSize`. The catalogue size badge must still appear below the inputs as before. The button label must be '+ Add Door Size'. The form card must use a dark warm brown background consistent with the image reference.",
