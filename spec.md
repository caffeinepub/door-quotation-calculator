# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display a read-only customer details section (name and mobile number) above the DoorEntryForm on the main door entry screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a read-only customer details section in the form view of App.tsx, above the DoorEntryForm component
- Show the customer name and mobile number collected from the CustomerInfoForm screen
- Style the section consistently with the existing amber/stone warm neutral theme

**User-visible outcome:** When a user reaches the door entry form, they can see the customer's name and mobile number displayed above the form, remaining visible while they add door entries.
