  "summary": "Both REQ-24 and REQ-25 appear to be substantially implemented. REQ-24 is addressed via refactored DimensionInput.tsx and DoorEntryForm.tsx with fraction parsing, stacked vertical inputs, correct placeholders, helper text, error states, catalogue badge, and '+ Add Door Size' button. REQ-25 is addressed via onClearDoors callback in App.tsx and QuotationView.tsx calling it after WhatsApp share. One minor gap exists: the helper text for the width input uses '30.25' examples instead of the spec-required '79.25' examples. A hallucinated extra button may have been added to QuotationView.",

      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Helper text below each input must read 'Enter as decimal (79.25) or fraction (79 1/4, 79 3/8)' for both height and width inputs",
      "reason": "The width input helper text in DimensionInput.tsx reads 'Enter as decimal (30.25) or fraction (30 1/4, 30 3/8)' rather than the specified identical text for both inputs",
